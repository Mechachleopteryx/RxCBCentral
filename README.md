# RxCBCentral

## Overview

This is a description of the library and what it does.

## Integration steps

These are the steps that need to be taken to integrate the library in a new app.

1. Add `//libraries/foundation/RxCentralBLE:RxCentralBLE` to your BUCK file.

2. `import RxCentralBLE`

3. Use classes to your heart's content.

## Usage

You can do two things with RxCentralBLE:

```
foo.bar();
```

or

```
foo.baz();
```

## Testing

This should describe how the object should be tested. For example, Portal has a separate `portal-test` module that includes a `PortalTestHelper` to register and clear objects with a test portal. AutoDispose provides a `TestScopeProvider` that can `create()` objects to be used during testing. Other libraries might have a `Foo` object that should be mocked or stubbed.
