# Contributing to RxCentralBLE

The Uber team welcomes contributions of all kinds, from simple bug reports through documentation, test cases, bugfixes, and features.

## Workflow

We love Phab tickets!

For small feature requests, a phab task first proposing it for discussion or demo implementation in a diff suffice.

For big features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of time on a feature that might need reworking.

Small diffs for things like typos, bugfixes, etc are always welcome.

## DOs and DON'Ts

- DO follow our coding style (link eventually goes here)
- DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
- DO run all Buck verification tasks (tests, lints, and ErrorProne checks) before submitting a diff

- DON'T submit diffs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.y
